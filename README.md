## **About the Project**

This project is carried out in order to test the knowledge acquired throughout the months spent at Holberton while seeking to contribute a little more knowledge and experience. In addition to this, develop soft skills in the area of ​​teamwork, collaborative synergy and problem solving along the way.

It was created looking simple and elegant but at the same time efficiency, unfortunately it still holds some memory leaks but that does not stop you from using it, it is a first great step in a long process.

To make this shell works you have to compile the next files:

		builtins.c
		commandaux.c
		commands.c
		executor.c
		interpreter.c
		main.c
		paths.c
		stringaux.c

Also in the same directory you must have the next files:

		holberton.h
		man1_simple_shell
